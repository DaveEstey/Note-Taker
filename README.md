# Note Taker

## Description
  
This project is to be used as a easy way to create notes, and recall what you need to do later on by selecting old notes. It was better to get a understanding of how routing and the back end communicates with each file. I learned that you should take all the routes and use the router import to clean up the back end within a index.js file.
